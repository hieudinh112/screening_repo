 ==== Start the test for the code with reduced workload for prescreening ==== 
 Relevant parameter in the calculation is reported here for reproduciable purpose 
 Range-separated parameter is 0.8000000000000000
Finish constructing the lattice sum!
The maximum dcut is 47.5022065056679708
The maximum Rcut is 59.3884120830859601
There are 66 shellpairs in the reference unit cell
There are 3301 images and we expect to have 217866 in total
There are 40668 shellpairs in the lattice sum after screening
 ==== The threshold for screening is ==== 0.0000000000000010
