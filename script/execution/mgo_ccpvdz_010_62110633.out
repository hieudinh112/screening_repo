 ==== Start the test for the code with reduced workload for prescreening ==== 
 Relevant parameter in the calculation is reported here for reproduciable purpose 
 Range-separated parameter is 1.0000000000000000
Finish constructing the lattice sum!
The maximum dcut is 47.3889577119960848
The maximum Rcut is 59.1580666671328359
There are 66 shellpairs in the reference unit cell
There are 3151 images and we expect to have 207966 in total
There are 40446 shellpairs in the lattice sum after screening
 ==== The threshold for screening is ==== 0.0000000000000010
